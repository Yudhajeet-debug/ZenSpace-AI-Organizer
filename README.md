**Stop living in a mess, man! It's time to organise like a Legend!** 🦁

**ZenSpace-AI-Organizer** is the smart way to reclaim your space. We all know the struggle of a messy room (especially when guests are coming!). Using advanced **Computer Vision**, this app analyses your room just by looking at it! 📸 It tells you exactly what to clean, where to put things, and how to achieve total Zen.

## ⚡ Power Features

* **👁️ AI Vision Scan:** Point your camera, and the AI identifies the clutter instantly. (Magical stuff!)
* **📝 Smart Task List:** Auto-generates a cleaning checklist based on the visual scan. No more thinking "Where do I start?"
* **💪 Manual Override:** For when you want to take control and tick off tasks yourself.
* **🚀 Productivity Boost:** Clear space = Clear mind. Get more done!

## 🛠️ How It Works

1.  **Snap:** Take a photo of your room or desk.
2.  **Scan:** Our AI analyses the chaos (identifies books, clothes, tech trash).
3.  **Solve:** Follow the generated plan to restore order.

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Core:** TypeScript & HTML5
* **AI:** Gemini / Computer Vision Integration
* **Styling:** CSS Modules / Tailwind (Inferred)
